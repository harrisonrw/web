## Overview
Quik is GoPro's video editing and media management app.  It gives creators tools for organizing, editing, and exporting their footage. I was a Staff Software Engineer on the macOS team, responsible for leading the development of core playback, editing, and export features.

## My Contributions
* **Lead Engineer – Media Playback & Editing**
    * Owned the integration of the Quik playback and editing engine API.
    * Implemented robust processing of Edit Decision Lists (EDL) to support Quik project workflows involving trims, reframing, effects, and music, ensuring edits were consistently applied across playback and export.
    * Architected and implemented a new video exporter.
    * Implemented remote video playback, using **AVFoundation** and **HLS (HTTP Live Streaming)**.


* **Feature Development & Camera Support**
    * Collaborated with cross-functional teams to ship features supporting GoPro’s **HERO** and **HERO13 Black** cameras.
    * Worked closely with Product, Design, and QA to align technical decisions with user and business goals.

* **Architecture & Implementation**
    * Applied an MVVM-I (Model–View–ViewModel–Interactor) architecture.
    * Heavy use of **Combine** for reactive data flows and UI updates.
    * Persisted media and user data locally using **Core Data**.
    * Implemented UI with a mix of **AppKit** and **SwiftUI**, choosing technologies based on stability, performance, and suitability for each feature.

* **Team Leadership & Collaboration**
    * Assisted teammates in design, debugging, and implementation.
    * Regularly participated in code reviews to maintain code quality.
    * Stepped into the team lead role during a transition, managing blockers and representing the team in leadership discussions.

## Overview
Thrive is the flagship product of **Finance AI**, a startup I co-founded to bring modern AI-powered insights to personal finance. Thrive helps individuals understand their money, discover patterns in their spending, and make smarter financial decisions through an intuitive, iOS-first experience.

## My Role
I led the **end-to-end development of the Thrive iOS app**, from initial architecture to App Store release. As technical co-founder, I was responsible for:
* Designing the app architecture (MVVM-I: Model‚ÄìView‚ÄìViewModel‚ÄìInteractor) to ensure scalability and maintainability.
* Implementing the app in **Swift and SwiftUI**, adopting modern frameworks and best practices.
* Integrating authentication with **Clerk** and secure bank account linking with **Plaid**.
* Persisting local data with **GRDB** while syncing updated data from REST APIs.
* Building a **dashboard screen powered by a headless CMS‚Äìinspired architecture**, rendering flexible components from a remote API in native SwiftUI.
* Managing iOS builds and App Store submissions.
* Writing **unit tests with Swift Testing Framework** and automating **screenshot generation with fastlane and Swift UI Testing Framework**.
* Leveraging **Swift 6 concurrency (async/await)** for clean, modern asynchronous code.
* Creating **low-fidelity mockups in Balsamiq** to support team design sessions.
* Using AI coding assistants (Claude Code and ChatGPT) to accelerate iteration.

## Key Achievements
* Successfully shipped Thrive to the App Store, where it now serves users seeking AI-powered financial intelligence.
* Delivered a flexible dashboard system that allows rapid iteration on new financial insights without requiring app updates.
* Established a sustainable technical foundation with testing, automation, and modern concurrency.

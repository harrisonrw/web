Hello! My name is Robert Harrison, and I am a software engineer, specialized in iOS, watchOS, and macOS app development.

I have over 15 years experience developing software for small startups, universities and large enterprises. In 2011, I founded [RWH Technology][rwhtechnology], to develop SpeakColors, a speech therapy app for the iPad. Through RWH Technology, I also provide development and consulting services to clients to develop their own apps. From 2014-2021, I developed award winning mobile apps for the University of San Diego. From 2022-2024, I worked at GoPro, on the macOS version of the Quik video editor app.

I graduated from the [University of Regina][UofR] with a B.Sc. degree majoring in Computer Science and a M.A.Sc. degree majoring in Electronic Systems Engineering.

I reside in San Diego, California with my wife and two Boston Terriers. In my spare time, I enjoy stand up paddle boarding, hiking, skiing and cooking.

My name is Robert Harrison and I am a software developer.  I provide iOS app development services through my company, [RWH Technology, LLC][rwhtechnology].  I can assist you with idea refinement, design, programming, testing and submitting to the App Store.

I have over 10 years experience developing software in the Customer Interaction Management, Environmental Engineering, Petroleum Engineering, Speech Language Pathology and Higher-Education fields. I've been developing iOS apps since 2011.

I graduated from the [University of Regina][UofR] with a B.Sc. degree majoring in Computer Science and a M.A.Sc. degree majoring in Electronic Systems Engineering.

I reside in San Diego, California with my wife, who is a Speech-Language Pathologist. Together, we develop apps for helping children improve their speech and language skills.

In my spare time, I enjoy stand up paddle boarding, hiking, skiing and cooking.
